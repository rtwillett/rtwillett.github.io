							<p>The following are a collection of projects that I've worked on, mostly in my spare time. Some are meant to install and use in other projects, some are works in progress, and some are stand-alone analyses.</p>

							<hr />

							<h2>General Tools</h2>
							<p>The following repos were written to be installed and used in other projects to streamline work.</p>

							<h3>Gordian</h3>
							<p>Project from Bellingcat's 2nd Hackathon. It was forked and adapted from the original project, which was a webapp, into a module that will assist with graph analysis and processing. <b>Still a work in progress</b></p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/rtwillett/gordian">link to source</a></p>
							
							<h3>DataMiningTools</h3>
							<p>Module comprised on various tools and components for use in data cleaning, processing, and analysis.</p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/rtwillett/DataMiningToolkit">link to source</a></p>

							<h3>Jabberwocky</h3>
							<p>Module for use in text mining and natural language processing (NLP).</p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/rtwillett/Jabberwocky">link to source</a></p>

							<h3>Janjira</h3>
							<p>Module for encryption and cybersecurity</p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/rtwillett/Janjira">link to source</a></p>

							<h3>DragonGlass</h3>
							<p>Module for programmatically working with the Obsidian notetaking platform. Allows the creation and mounting of vaults and writing and deleting notes.</p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/rtwillett/DragonGlass">link to source</a></p>



							<hr />

							<h2>Analytics</h2>

							<h3>KOL Mapper</h3>
							<p>This project was written to mine all of the literature about a particular topic from Google Scholar and then do graph analysis to determine authors who are the most central to the field.</p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/rtwillett/KOLMap">link to source</a></p>

							<h3>Air Quality</h3>
							<p>Project that read down data from swarms of atmospheric sensors from several air quality monitoring networks as well as data from the TRAX air quality monitoring project. These data were then process and used to render dynamic heatmap animations of air quality over time in Salt Lake City, Utah. The heatmaps were generated using inverse density weighted calculation and rendering the maps with an unconventional combination of Mapdeck, Selenium, and image processing in Python.</p>
							<p><i>source currently private</i></p>
							<img src="images/winter2017-2018.gif" style="width:200px; text-align:auto; display:block"><br />
							<p><i>Inverse density weighted heat map of pm 2.5 air pollution in Salt Lake City, Utah during winter (common time for atmospheric inversion). The visualization was constructed by a swarm of fixed air sensors throughout the city and from the data read in from the elevated rail system. Can you find the copper smelter in the west of the city?</i></p>

								<h1 class="major">Scientific Projects</h1>
								<p>Transcription factors are proteins used by cells to switch genes on/off, regulating cellular programming (gene expression). I became interested in the molecular logic of gene expression while working as an undergraduate in the laboratory of <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/biology/faculty/rosbash-michael.html">Michael Rosbash</a> on the expression of circadian genes and this trend carried through my graduate (<a href="https://www.pathology.columbia.edu/profile/lloyd-greene-phd">Lloyd Greene</a>) and postgraduate work (<a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/alexandra-joyner">Alexandra Joyner</a>).</p>

								<p>The engrailed family of homeodomain transcription factors are typically expressed in regions of developing tissue and play important roles for shaping those structures. Although, mutations in engrailed genes were known to cause disruptions in growth and shape of the developing cerebellum, our group chose to focus on a more targeted approach to identify the roles of these genes in specific cell lineages and developmental times. The work led to the discovery that a development of a set of deeper structures in the cerebellum and a signal integration hub for cerebellar activity, known as the cerbellar nuclei, affect the size and shape of the cerebellum as a whole.</p>
								<p>The work also exposed me to graph theory for the first time and, together with the genomics component of the project, got me started me on my data science journey.<br />

								<h3>Ph.D. Work <br />
									Columbia University</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/gata2_expression.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>GATA-2 is a zinc finger transcription factor that has been shown to be crucial for cell fate specification and proliferation in a number of different tissues and organisms. Originally identified in a screen as a gene regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF), and found to be expressed throughout the developing midbrain and sympathetic nervous system, I carried out a number of studies primarily using shRNA knockdown and in-utero electroporation on embryonic rat midbrain to demonstrate that GATA-2 is required for differentiation of neurons in the superior collicolus of the brain. <br />
